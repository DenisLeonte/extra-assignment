This repository stores the files of the extra assignment in the Object Oriented Programming course by Diana Borza.
The folder format will be extra-assignment-x where x is the number of the assignment.
I will not be using Visual Studio 2022 for developing, I will be using Visual Studio Code instead.
From this we can deduce the fact that a .sln file will not be present.
I will instead post here a command to build the files in the terminal.
