//This program will be tasked with cypering and decyphering the Caesar chyper.
//The Caesar cypher takes a phrase and off-sets each letter by a key K.
//We will de-cypher a cyphered phrase using the ci-squared algorithm. We create a frequency map for each letter and we compare with the english frequency map.
//The lowest ci-square will be the key offset.
//This program will also provide an UI and menu for more actions.
